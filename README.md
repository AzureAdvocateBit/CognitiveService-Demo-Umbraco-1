# Using Cognitive Services in Umbraco

This sample code show's how to add the [Computer Vision Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision//face/) and [Face Api](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/face/) to Umbraco.

All the magic happens in two event handlers  
* Face API in file [App_Start/FaceEventsHandler.cs](./DemoWebsite.Web/App_Start/FaceEventsHandler.cs)  
* Cumputer Vision API in file [App_Start/ComputerVisionEventsHandler.cs](./DemoWebsite.Web/App_Start/ComputerVisionEventsHandler.cs)  

Any questions please have a look at [the article on my blog](https://www.henkboelman.com)
